Looking at your schema, I can see you need to track which sites have which hashes for verification purposes. Let me propose a solution with an additional table and Python method.

First, let's add a table to store site verification data:

```sql
-- Table to store site verification reports
CREATE TABLE site_verification (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    site_name VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    path TEXT NOT NULL,
    reported_hash VARCHAR(40),
    verification_time INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP()),
    is_root_verification BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    
    -- Foreign key to sites table
    FOREIGN KEY (site_name) REFERENCES site_list(site_name) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
    -- Indexes for performance
    INDEX idx_site_name (site_name),
    INDEX idx_path (path(255)),
    INDEX idx_reported_hash (reported_hash),
    INDEX idx_verification_time (verification_time),
    INDEX idx_composite (site_name, path(255), verification_time)
);
```

Now, here's the Python method to determine site synchronization status:

```python
import mysql.connector
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SiteStatus:
    site_name: str
    is_current: bool
    has_previous: bool
    conflicting_hash: Optional[str] = None

class SiteVerificationChecker:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.db = db_connection
    
    def check_site_sync_status(self, target_path: str) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]:
        """

```

Key features of this solution:

1. **site_verification table**: Stores what each site reports during verification
2. **Merkle tree traversal**: Checks parent directories to see if any have the correct hash
3. **Root hash verification**: Sites can report just the root hash to prove they're in sync
4. **Previous hash checking**: Identifies sites that don't even have the previous version
5. **Conflicting hash tracking**: Records what incorrect hashes sites actually have

The method works by:
1. Getting the current/previous hashes for the target path
2. For each site, checking if they have the correct hash either directly or via a parent directory
3. Categorizing sites as out-of-sync or completely missing based on their verification reports

This approach leverages the merkle tree property where having the correct hash for a parent directory proves all children are also correct.
