This comprehensive test suite includes:

## Test Structure:
- **DBConnectionTestMixin**: Contains all the core interface tests that both implementations must pass
- **TestMYSQLConnection**: Tests specific to the MySQL implementation with mocked connections
- **TestLocalMemoryConnection**: Tests specific to the local memory implementation
- **TestInterfaceCompatibility**: Ensures both implementations have compatible interfaces

## Test Coverage:
1. **CRUD Operations**: Insert, update, retrieve, and delete operations for both hash records and logs
2. **Error Handling**: Tests for missing required fields, invalid parameters, and edge cases
3. **Data Validation**: Ensures proper validation of input parameters
4. **Return Types**: Verifies that methods return the expected data types and structures
5. **Interface Compatibility**: Ensures both implementations can be used interchangeably

## Key Features:
- Uses mocking for MySQL tests to avoid requiring actual database connections
- Tests both success and failure scenarios
- Validates that both implementations behave identically for the same inputs
- Includes edge cases like empty results, invalid parameters, and non-existent records

## Running the Tests:
```bash
python test_DB_connections.py
```
```bash
python -m squishy_REST_API.tests.test_DB_connections
```
The tests will verify that both implementations correctly implement the DBConnection interface and can be used as drop-in replacements for each other.
